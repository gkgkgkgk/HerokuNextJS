# Getting Started

Before you get started, make sure you have the following things installed:
* nodejs (I recommend 14+)
* npm
* git

In order to clone the repository, run ```git clone git@github.com:gkgkgkgk/HerokuNextJS.git```

Then, go into the directory, and run ```npm install```

Then, run ```npm run dev```.

Navigate to localhost:3000 in your browser, and you should see it running.
