    <div>

      <h3>Pages</h3>
      <p>To create a page, add a folder in the pages directory that is named after the page you are making.</p>
      <p>For example, if you are making an "About US" page, make a folder called AboutUs. Then, put a file called index.js in that directory, and you can start building thqat page!</p>
      <hr />
      <h3>APIs</h3>
      <p>To create an API endpoint, add a file named after the endpoint in the api folder.</p>
      <p>For example, if you are making an endpoint that returns the word hello, as seen in this boilerplate code, make a file called hello.js. This file will automatically be linked to the endpoint /api/hello.</p>
      <hr />
      <h3>Components</h3>
      <p>To create a React component, add a folder with the name of the component in the components directory.</p>
